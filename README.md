LLM_Project.ipynb is the notebook used to preprocess the dataset, set up the architecture and train it.
COMS6998_Final_Project_Concurrent_Inference.ipynb is the notebook that sets up the inference pipeline with and without concurrency, benchmarks both and analyzes the results.

In order to run both notebooks, click the dropdown on the LLM_Project_Data folder name, go to organize and click add shortcut. This will add a shortcut to this folder in your Drive so that when you mount you will have this folder in your '/content/drive/MyDrive' directory.
Then just run notebooks normally.
