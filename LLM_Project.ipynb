They told me I needed to call a different number, but I'm not sure which one that CanNeil: I apologize for the confusion, Mammie. Let me see if I can do to help. Can you tell me a little more about what you're looking for in a tax-advantaged account? Are you interested in a specific type, account, such as a 401(k) or an IRA?\n",

Contributions to this account are tax-deductible, and the funds grow tax-deferred until you withdraw them in retirement. We also offer a Roth IRA, which doesn't allow tax-deductible contributions, but the funds grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Finally, we have a SEP-IRA, which is designed for self-employed individuals or small business owners. This account allows for higher contribution limits, but there are more complex eligibility requirements.\n",

You can deduct your contributions on your taxes, which could you'll lower your taxable income. The deduction is subject to certain income limits, but I can walk you through those details if you'd like.\n",

There are also fees for transactions or withdrawals. However, if you withdraw funds before age 59 1/2, you may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.\n",

Examples include mentions of opening or closing accounts, expressing interest in new banking products or services, changing transaction volumes or values, or altering usage patterns that have a clear, measurable impact on revenue.\n",

This might include their overall satisfaction, trust, and loyalty; their life circumstances that may alter financial needs (such as moving, career changes, or family events); and the breadth and depth of their existing relationship with the bank (e.g., multiple products or family members also banking at the same institution).\n",
